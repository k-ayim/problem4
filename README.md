# Problem 4

This Java program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

## Instructions

1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the `Problem4FactorialCalculator.java` file using a Java compiler.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled program.
   - Enter a number when prompted.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will output the factorial of the entered number.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `factorial` method is O(n), where n is the number being calculated. This is because the method recursively calls itself n times to calculate the factorial.
